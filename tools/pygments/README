To add this lexer to your pygment installation you have to have python setuptools installed. Then just run:

python setup.py install

For an installation in your home directory:

python setup.py install

If you get an error message on home installation, just read it, it should help (usually it's just a missing PYTHONPATH). Once the setup is complete, just run pygmentize to generate a syntax highlighted HTML file. For example:

pygmentize -l simpel -O full,style=pastie -f html -o vote.html vote.simpel
